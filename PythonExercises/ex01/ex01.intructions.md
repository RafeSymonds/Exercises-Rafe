## Overview Python ex01
For this exercise you will create a program that calculates the mean, median, and mode. You are not allowed to use the built in mean, median, and mode functions.

## Input
You will be given 3 empty functions all of which take 1 list as a parameter. The lists will be sorted for all 3 functinos

## Example
If **1,1,2,3,4,5** are inputted, the mean is 2.67, the median is 2.5, and the mode is 1.

## Test your code
1. Run your python file with `python3 Python/ex01/ex01.py`
2. To run a test cases use `python3 -m pytest testingFiles/Python/ex01/test_ex01.py`

3. using GitHub
    1. Run **`git add .`** to prepare **all** changes for commit
    2. Run **`git commit -m "commit message"`** to make changes permanent in the local repository
    3. Run **`git push`** to push your changes to your remote repository
    4. Look at results found in
        * the Actions window of GitHub
