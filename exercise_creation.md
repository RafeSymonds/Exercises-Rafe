# Exercise Creation Guide
In order to create an exercise there are 4 major parts.

## Instruction Creation
Create a new folder in either the C++ or Python exercise folder.   
Create an instruction file called `ex??.instructions.md`  
Create a C++ or Python file called `ex??.cpp` or `ex??.py` and fill in any needed starter code.

## Test Case Creation
Create a new folder `ex??` in either the C++ or Python testing folder.

### C++ Test Cases
C++ testing utilizes file redirection for input and output. Therefore, correct output files should be prepared in advance. C++ exercises execute via a main function, processing data derived from the input files.

### Python Test Cases
Python tests are established using the PyTest framework. The verification process involves ensuring the output from specific functions is accurate through the use of `assert` commands.

### GitHub Workflow File
To set up the automated grading on GitHub, duplicate the preceding auto-grader configuration and replace the exercise identifiers with those relevant to the new exercise. Itâ€™s advisable to retain similarity in file naming to the ones before, enabling straightforward updates by just altering the exercise name. Should the C++ exercises require a varying number of test cases, additional run instructions can be scripted.
