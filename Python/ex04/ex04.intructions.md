## Overview Python ex04

For this exercise you will create a program that merges 2 sorted arrays and returns the final array sorted.

You are NOT allowed to use any sort functions.

# Merge 2 Sorted Arrays
Given 2 arrays you will return a sorted combination of the elements. 



## Input
You are given 2 non-empty sorted arrays. The sizes could be the same or different

## Example
If **[1,2,6,25]** is and **[2,5,6,8]** are inputted,   
your code should return: **[1,2,2,5,6,6,8,25]** 

## Test your code
1. Run your python file with `python3 Python/ex04/ex04.py`
2. To run a test cases use `python3 -m pytest testingFiles/Python/ex04/test_ex04.py`

3. using GitHub
    1. Run **`git add .`** to prepare **all** changes for commit
    2. Run **`git commit -m "commit message"`** to make changes permanent in the local repository
    3. Run **`git push`** to push your changes to your remote repository
    4. Look at results found in
        * the Actions window of GitHub
        * the GitHub Actions extension window for VSCode
