## Overview Python ex05

For this exercise you will create a program that calculates the value of the fibonacci sequence at a certain index

# Fibonacci Sequence
A value in the fibonacci sequence is the sum of the previous 2 numbers.
Therefore, the fibonacci sequence goes like
>0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, . . .

We say the 0 is the 0th element, 1 is the 1st element, and so on

## Input
You are given an empty function. You must write the function with the given input

## Example
If **5** is inputted, your code should return 5
If **3** is inputted, your code should return 

## Tips
This program can easily be solved recursively. However, the recursive version is incredibly slow and the heavy test cases will never finish.

You must solve this using iteration. This can be done in O(n) time.  
Do not worry if you do not know what that means. It just means you can solve it in 1 loop

## Test your code
1. Run your python file with `python3 Python/ex05/ex05.py`
2. To run a test cases use `python3 -m pytest testingFiles/Python/ex05/test_ex05.py`

3. using GitHub
    1. Run **`git add .`** to prepare **all** changes for commit
    2. Run **`git commit -m "commit message"`** to make changes permanent in the local repository
    3. Run **`git push`** to push your changes to your remote repository
    4. Look at results found in
        * the Actions window of GitHub
        * the GitHub Actions extension window for VSCode
