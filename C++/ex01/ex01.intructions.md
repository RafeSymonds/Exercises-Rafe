## Overview ex01

For this exercise you will create a program that prints out all the numbers 5 and 10 inclusive. Each number should be printed on a different line.   

## Example
Your program should output: 

5  
6  
7  
8
9
10

Your program will have a blank line at the end.

## Test your code
1. Compile the file with "make ex01" 
2. Run your executable with "./C++/ex01/ex01.exe"
3. To compare your results with the correct results you will **either** need to push to your GitHub repository or run the tests locally
    1. using GitHub
        1. Run **git add .** to prepare **all** changes for commit
        2. Run **git commit -m "commit message"** to make changes permanent in the local repository
        3. Run **git push** to push your changes to your remote repository
        4. Look at results found in
            * the Actions window of GitHub
            * the GitHub Actions extension window for VSCode

    1. run your code and compare with output
        1. run "./C++/ex01/ex01.exe > ./C++/ex01/ex01.output1.txt" to run the test and save its output to a .txt file
        2. compare results of the test to the actual resutls with "diff ./C++/ex01/ex01.output1.txt testingFiles/C++/ex01/CorrectOutput/ex01.correct.output1.txt"
            1. **if nothing is printed, it means your output is the same as the correct output**
